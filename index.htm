		<h2>Welcome to Scales...</h2>
		</p>
		<p>
		We are situated in the Lake District National Park on the east side of the Mungrisdale valley. Our site directly overlooks the mountains of Blencathra, Bannerdale and Carrock, and is set in the heart of the northern Lake District fells - everyone tells us that the views are breathtakingly beautiful.
		</p>
		<p>
		The site is positioned in a level, sheltered area at one end of a five acre wildflower meadow. The grass in the actual camping area is kept cut to lawn-length for the benefit of visitors. Hardstandings are provided for five caravans with cars, and each emplacement is surrounded by ample grass for the siting of awnings/windbreaks etc. Additionally, and subject to ground conditions there is a separate, grassed area (lawn-length, again) with hook-up, water and refuse provision a short distance from the 5-van site, which caters for group-bookings, or campers who prefer a different view of the mountains to wake up to.
		</p>

		<p>
		Facilities are basic (drinking water, chemical toilet disposal, refuse amenity and 10 Amp electric hook-ups, together with ample extension leads!) but immaculately maintained. It is <i>essential</i> that you have your own toilet/washing facilities. 
		</p>
		<p>
		We are happy to accept dogs providing that they are kept under strict control and are quiet at all times. We also ask that they are exercised off site.
		</p>
		<p>
		The Mungrisdale area is one of the most beautiful in the Lake District and benefits from being less crowded than the more "traditional" locations. Even in high season, the country roads are quiet and ideal for cycling and visitors are welcome to walk or cycle in the sprawling Greystoke Forest, just 500metres off-site. There are more challenging routes for keen mountain-bikers just a short ride away, including the very popular Skiddaw House route….

		<p>
		The whole area is a haven for wildlife and of special interest to ornithologists. Regular visitors to the site include buzzards, badgers and deer, with occasional appearances from our own pets!
		</p>
		<p>
		Further afield, popular locations to visit include Penrith (12 miles), Keswick (12 miles), Ullswater (10 miles), and Caldbeck (7 miles). The nearest supermarkets are Morrisons, Sainsbury’s, Booth’s and Aldi in Penrith, and there are village stores in Hesket Newmarket (four and a half miles), Skelton (5 miles) and Greystoke (7 miles).  Hesket Newmarket is also home to the cooperative-owned Old Crown Inn and brewery, where Prince Charles is almost a local!
		</p>
		<p>
		Scales has been described as a "one in a million" location and offers the perfect opportunity to stay in a peaceful environment amongst unspoilt and magnificent countryside.
		</p>
		<p>
		We are open all year, weather conditions permitting. Booking is advisable.
